                            Representation and access to language-concordant learning materials have been identified as potential factors influencing emotional outcomes for children with neurologic conditions.

                            <b id ="projectSubHeader">DESCRIPTION</b></br>
                            The objective of this project is to create and distribute children's literature that features racially diverse characters dealing with neurologic conditions. This initiative aims to address the gap in inclusive representation within health education materials. Five new children's books will be developed, each portraying characters from different racial backgrounds who are navigating the challenges of neurologic conditions. These stories will be translated into Spanish and Swahili, enabling distribution to language-concordant clinics in the Bay area, where they can benefit children and families who share those languages. The project's timeline involves the collaborative creation of the literature, including content development, illustrations, and formatting. By December, the books will be printed and made available on platforms like Amazon for broader accessibility. If you choose to continue with Think Neuro after the internship, data collection will begin in March, capturing before-and-after statistics along with demographic information to assess the impact of the literature on emotional outcomes and understanding of neurologic conditions. Throughout the project, the intern cohort will play a pivotal role in conducting initial and follow-up outreach to study participants, contributing to the gathering of valuable insights.</p>

                            The opioid epidemic continues to pose significant challenges in many communities, including San Bernardino. Limited English proficiency, non-native English speakers, and individuals with English as a second language often face barriers to accessing accurate information about opioid use and abuse. Increasing education and knowledge about opioids is crucial to empower these populations to make informed decisions, reduce opioid abuse, and improve patient outcomes.</p>
                            
                            <b id ="projectSubHeader">DESCRIPTION</b></br>
                            The primary aim of this project is to enhance knowledge and awareness regarding opioid use and abuse among populations with limited English proficiency, non-native English speakers, and those for whom English is a second language in the San Bernardino area. The project will undertake a comprehensive community outreach effort to decrease substance abuse from vulnerable populations. The project's logistical approach involves the creation of innovative educational materials focused on opioid abuse and management. These materials, whether in the form of infographics, short papers, or videos, will be developed with the goal of engaging and convincing individuals who are already struggling with substance addiction. The internship cohort will play a crucial role in conducting community outreach, distributing the educational materials, and administering initial surveys to gather baseline data. The project timeline will include outreach to San Bernardino to gauge the best type of educational material to produce, followed by the development of educational materials, and concluding with dispersal efforts to communities and organizations dealing with substance abuse populations during the second month. If interested in continuing with Think Neuro at the conclusion of the internship, the intern cohort will also engage in follow-up outreach to study participants to measure final statistics in 2024. As community coordinators of this project, the intern cohort is expected to demonstrate intrinsic motivation, problem-solving skills, and the drive to publish impactful results. Weekly meetings with mentors will offer support, guidance, and an opportunity for addressing questions related to project timelines and administrative matters. </p>

                            Quality of care disparities between patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) and patients proficient in English have been well documented. Language barriers between patients and providers can lead to medical errors, poor chronic condition management, and undue difficulty accessing care. LEP status is highly correlated with other risk factors for low quality of care, including being uninsured, low income, having lower educational attainment, and being born outside of the U.S.. In California, an estimated 7 million people speak English “less than very well”, making professional medical interpretation a key resource for addressing quality of care disparities.</p>
                            <b id ="projectSubHeader">DESCRIPTION</b></br>
                            The central objective of the Second Medical Language Exchange project is to establish robust partnerships and rapport with limited English proficiency (LEP) populations in the Bay Area, facilitating the delivery of essential health information and education in their native languages. This initiative is geared towards improving health outcomes by ensuring equitable access to accurate medical information and resources. The project's strategy involves forming collaborative relationships with key organizations that serve LEP communities, such as Chinese for Affirmative Action. These partnerships will facilitate trust-building and effective communication, allowing for the delivery of culturally sensitive and linguistically tailored health materials. Initially focusing on the two most widely spoken languages in California outside of English – Spanish and Chinese – the project aspires to produce health education materials in these languages. The project timeline encompasses multiple stages. The first phase involves building partnerships and rapport with LEP populations, engaging in dialogue to understand their needs and preferences. Simultaneously, the project leaders will collaborate with medical professionals and linguists to develop accurate and comprehensive health education materials. These materials will then be tested for effectiveness and cultural appropriateness within the target communities. Throughout the project, the intern cohort, under the guidance of the project leaders, will actively participate in community outreach, material development, and engagement with LEP populations. The aim is not only to improve access to health information but also to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their healthcare. The project also emphasizes the importance of sustainability, aiming to establish a foundation for continued support and engagement beyond the project's scope. Weekly meetings will provide a platform for interns to seek guidance, share progress, and discuss project-related matters. </p>
